## Description

Frustrated Blob is a small platformer-style interactive sketch built in p5.js that explores the emotion of frustration through movement and environment design. The blob moves with snappy horizontal acceleration, heavy gravity, and abrupt stopping, making navigation feel intentionally resistant.

The environment is designed with cramped platforms and low ceilings to encourage frequent collisions. A simple mischief mechanic allows the blob to push boxes and steal coins, offering small outlets for release without providing a traditional win condition.

## Setup and Interaction Instructions

Click on the canvas to ensure keyboard input is active.

Controls:
- Move left/right: A / D or Left / Right Arrow
- Jump: Space, W, or Up Arrow
- Touch boxes to push them.
- Touch coins to steal them.

## Iteration Notes

Post-Playtest
- Adjusted horizontal collision logic so standing on platforms no longer blocks left and right movement.
- Added bounds and respawn logic to prevent the simulation from breaking when the blob exits the canvas.
- Refined head collision resolution to reduce jitter and repeated overlaps.
